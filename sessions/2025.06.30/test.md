## 📜 **1️⃣ Group Outcome Table (Sorted by Difference)**

| Difference | Group Outcome                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13+        | **A Legendary Legacy**: The sanctuaries endure, but how they change is left to fate. The players’ actions echo across history, their story whispered from halls to forests.         |
| 10–12      | **A Turning Point**: The sanctuaries survive and shift—what new alliances, challenges, or revelations might follow is uncertain. The world is altered, but its future is unwritten. |
| 7–9        | **A Hard-Won Victory**: The sanctuaries stand, but something was lost or changed. Old scars remain, and not all threads are tied. The players decide what that means.               |
| 4–6        | **A Quiet Success**: The sanctuaries are preserved, but their power dims or falters. The heroes’ names may be remembered, but the cost remains unclear.                             |
| 1–3        | **A Complicated Outcome**: The sanctuaries hold, but cracks are visible. Loss, betrayal, or sacrifice shadow the victory. The players shape what remains.                           |
| 0          | **A Tenuous Balance**: The sanctuaries remain, but at what cost? New questions and threats linger. The players choose how to face what comes next.                                  |
| –1 to –3   | **A Hollow Victory**: The sanctuaries survive in form but not in spirit. What is lost may outweigh what is saved. The players decide what is left behind.                           |
| –4 to –6   | **A Fractured Future**: One or both sanctuaries falter. The bond between the races and their lands cracks. What remains of their alliance is uncertain.                             |
| –7 to –9   | **A Grim Reversal**: The sanctuaries fail or are irrevocably changed. The players’ legacies are marked by what they couldn’t prevent.                                               |
| –10 to –12 | **A Great Fall**: The sanctuaries collapse or are lost. Their power shifts the world’s balance, but what follows is up to those left behind.                                        |
| –13+       | **An Ending and a Beginning**: The sanctuaries and their bonds are shattered. What new power rises—or what darkness claims the remnants—is left for the players to decide.          |
