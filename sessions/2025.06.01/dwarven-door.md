Awesome! Let’s craft the puzzle with your chosen rune names, keeping the tailored challenges and effects intact but fully aligned with your desired rune **themes**: **Craftsmanship, Revelry, Loyalty, Strength, Knowledge, Sacrifice**. I’ll ensure each has a **clue, visual, reward, and meaningful failure**.

# 🧩 **Puzzle of the Six Dwarven Runes**
"Por estes seis, o caminho se abre para aqueles que vivem pela verdade da pedra. Mas somente aqueles que os honrarem com as ações corretas terão passagem concedida. 
As chaves da montanha somente sao reveladas aqueles que as possuem dentro de si.
Aquele que dorme eh amassado pela montanha, sobrevivem aqueles que agem."

---

### 📍 **Setup**

* In the chamber, the hidden **fortress door is sealed by six dwarven runes**, each requiring a specific **act tied to dwarven values** to activate.
* The **Sacrifice Rune is already active**, its glow hinting at what’s to come.

### 4️⃣ **Rune of Loyalty** *(Group Challenge)*

* **Visual**: Intertwined **dwarven hands and shields**, surrounded by dwarven words for **"Brotherhood" and "Kin"**.
* **Clue**: A partial inscription reads: *“Unidos estamos, como irmãos triunfamos. Na morte caímos, mas juntos nos estaremos”*
* **Challenge**: The party must **lock arms or stand in a circle**, performing a **group Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) DC13** check representing their unity.
* **Reward**: The rune glows, and all characters gain **Inspiration (one reroll)**.
* **Failure**: A shadowy tremor surges, knocking the group **prone** and causing a **-2 penalty on Strength checks** for 10 minutes.

---

### 5️⃣ **Rune of Strength** *(Tailored for the Druid, but open)*

* **Visual**: **A clenched fist, a hammer, and a mountain** carved into the wall.
* **Clue**: Faint markings read: *“Strength is more than force, it is resilience in the face of storm.”*
* **Challenge**: The Druid (or another) must **lift a heavy stone blocking a hidden rune segment**. **Strength (Athletics) DC15** or **Shape Earth spell**.
* **Reward**: The rune shines, granting a **temporary HP shield (5 temp HP)**.
* **Failure**: The stone collapses, pinning the character’s foot (**Restrained for 1 round**) and causing **1d6 bludgeoning damage**.

---

### 6️⃣ **Rune of Knowledge** *(Tailored for the Sorcerer)*

* **Visual**: Engraved **open books, star maps, and arcane symbols**.
* **Clue**: Scattered scrolls hint: *“Stars speak to those who listen. Read the signs, unlock the path.”*
* **Challenge**: The Sorcerer must **decipher a star map**, using **Arcana (DC15)** or **Intelligence (Investigation) DC14**.
* **Reward**: The rune illuminates, and the Sorcerer gains **Advantage on Arcana checks** for an hour and a **clue about the children’s tattoos**.
* **Failure**: The rune releases a **blinding light**; the Sorcerer is **Blinded for 1 round** and **loses their reaction** until the end of their next turn.

---

### 🌟 **Integrated Battle**

* As the party solves the runes, **drow raiders attack**, forcing them to fight while completing challenges.
* Each **rune activation** shifts the battlefield: light changes, runes create barriers, or spirits emerge.

---

### 🎲 **After the Puzzle**

* The final rune’s glow opens the **hidden fortress door**.
* An **elven warrior** arrives, carrying a **child** linked to the Engines of Fate. The warrior is **struck by a drow arrow**, urging the party to **save the child**.
* They must decide: **enter the fortress, fight, or flee with the child**.
  **Skill Challenge**: Athletics, Acrobatics, Insight, Stealth (DC12–14), with rewards and penalties based on results.

---

### 🏰 **Fortress Interior**

* A **corridor lined with ancient murals** depicting the **Chosen Children** with **tattoos of power**, hinting at the drow's goal.
* **Mechanical rumbling** from deep within signals danger.
* The session **ends on a cliffhanger**, with a **massive shadow approaching** and the realization that the fortress’s heart is compromised.


🔥 Option 2: The Living Wall
The party passes the murals, and the stone itself shudders and cracks. Suddenly, the murals animate—figures of dwarves and elves step out of the stone, forming stone guardians with glowing tattoos. The fortress locks down, and the session ends with the players surrounded by living statues murmuring:
"The Chosen must not escape."
