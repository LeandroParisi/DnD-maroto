You will help me categorize battle maps for a DnD game.

The maps will be located on the folder: .maps/_to-categorize on the root of the directory.

Each other folder on the .maps folder represents one category, read all the folder names to know the categories.

What you need to do is:
1. Read all folders inside .maps in order to know which are the categories
2. Pre categorize: Rename the maps inside .maps/_to-categorize as <category-name>_<number>
3. Wait for my approval
4. Move the categorized maps to their respective folders

Important: Each maps can have only one category, when in doubt choose the one that best represent the map category.
If you cannot categorize a map, you can add it to 10.uncategorized
