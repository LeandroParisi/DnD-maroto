The maps inside _to-categorize are properlly categorized, but they are out of order, there might be missing numbers for example:
file A: forest_1
file B: forest_3
missing forest_2

Also, some might have only a placeholder for the number, like x

Reorganize them (fixing the numbers)

IMPORTANT: DON`T change the categories (name sufix of the files), only the numbers
